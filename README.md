For JAVA: in this repository I will put some of my CodeWars solutions that I find interesting for some reason (or I learned something significant from them!).
All the rest (JS, SQL, etc.): I add either interesting files or files showing my certain-language-level

My CodeWars account: https://www.codewars.com/users/chybrydra

Dictionary:
CodeWars - website dedicated to coders, giving an opportunity to do Kata's in over 20 programming languages. Users can not only solve problems, but also create their own challenges.
Kata - a coding challenge, usually it's a method to write.
kyu - difficulty od kata (8 - easiest, 1 - insanely hard, there are also "beta" kata's which get their grading later).

The files are stored this way:
CodeWars/certainLanguage/difficultyByKyu
difficulties by kyu are CodeWars gradings (kyu, explained above)
